# Introduction and objectives

This course introduces formal semantics of programming languages. It starts
with different semantic approaches (operational, denotational, and axiomatic)
in the imperative setting. It then focusses on the semantics of functional
languages, with lambda-calculus as the central core.

Learning outcomes:
+ To describe the prominent features of operational, axiomatic and denotational
  approaches to the semantics of programming languages.
+ To attribute formal meaning to different aspects of a simple imperative or functional language.
+ To use inductive techniques to argue about properties of programming languages.
+ To use lambda-calculus as a computational model and as a rewriting system.
+ To use type systems for regulating the good formation of programs.
